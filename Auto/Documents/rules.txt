Date rules

1. If claim date is before policy start date, then claim request is rejected.

Client.policy.claim.ClaimDate < Client.policy.ValidFromDate



2. If claim loss date is on or before the claim date, then claim is valid.


Client.policy.claim.LossDate <= Client.policy.claim.ClaimDate



3. The claim date is after the policy start date but the claim loss date is after the claim date which is suspicious. This case needs to be manually reviewed.
